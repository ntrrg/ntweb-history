# Objective

Today, we're building on our knowledge of *Arrays* by adding another dimension.
Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

**Context:**

Given a `6 x 6` *2D Array*, `A`:

```
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

We define an hourglass in `A` to be a subset of values with indices falling in
this pattern in `A`'s graphical representation:

```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

There are `16` hourglasses in `A`, and an *hourglass sum* is the sum of an
hourglass' values.

# Task

Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in `A`, then print the
*maximum* hourglass sum.

# Input Format

There are `6` lines of input, where each line contains `6` space-separated
integers describing *2D Array* `A`; every value in `A` will be in the inclusive
range of `-9` to `9`.

**Constraints:**

* `-9 <= A[i][j] <= 9`

* `0 <= i,j <= 5`

# Output Format

Print the largest (maximum) hourglass sum found in `A`.

# Sample 00

{{< challenge-sample "00" >}}

## Explanation

`A` contains the following hourglasses:

```
1 1 1  1 1 0  1 0 0  0 0 0
  1      0      0      0
1 1 1  1 1 1  1 0 0  0 0 0

0 1 0  1 0 0  0 0 0  0 0 0
  1      1      0      0
0 0 2  0 2 4  2 4 4  4 4 0

1 1 1  1 1 0  1 0 0  0 0 0
  0      2      4      4
0 0 0  0 0 2  0 2 0  2 0 0

0 0 2  0 2 4  2 4 4  4 4 0
  0      0      2      0
0 0 1  0 1 2  1 2 4  2 4 0
```

The hourglass with the maximum sum (`19`) is:

```
2 4 4
  2
1 2 4
```
