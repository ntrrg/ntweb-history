# Objective

In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.
Check out the Tutorial tab to learn more.

# Task

Given an integer, `n`, print its first `10` multiples. Each multiple `n * i`
(where `1 <= i <= 10`) should be printed on a new line in the form: `n x i =
result`.

# Input Format

A single integer, `n`.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 20`

# Output Format

Print `10` lines of output; each line `i` (where `1 <= i <= 10`) contains the
`result` of `n x i` in the form: `n x i = result`.

# Sample

{{< challenge-sample "00" >}}

# Solution

{{< snippet "main.go" "go" true >}}
