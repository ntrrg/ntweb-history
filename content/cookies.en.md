* Comments are loaded. If you don't want them, just don't click *Â«{{< i18n

If you use only **Open Source** products, sorry about using cookies, I will
replace Disqus as my comments platform in the future.

If you use private source products, worrying about privacy and using this
products is like worrying about global warming and not recycling.. So just
don't do it.. ðŸ˜’
