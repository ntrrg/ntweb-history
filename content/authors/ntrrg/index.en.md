Hi! I am Miguel Angel, just another developer working hard to not be just
another developer.

Before underestimating this website because its simplicity, see [how it works](./../../projects/ntweb/index.en.md).

## What can I do for you?

I am a Software Developer passionate about creating high performance solutions
that take the most advantage they can from the hardware they use. I always code
following the best standards, verifying the code quality with analysis tools
and automated tests. I am a huge fan of maths, process automation, distributed
computing and Open Source.

Since I coded my first lines in Go (July 2018), I knew that its simplicity,
power and philosophy are the experience that any developer pursuing
productivity and efficiency needs. I coded with PHP, Python and JavaScript
(Node.js) in the past. I also finished the 42 C Piscine in Silicon Valley, so I
have basic knowledge of C.

### Skills

* **Programming languages:** Go, C, JavaScript, Python, PHP.

* **User interfaces:** Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

* **Databases:** SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL), K/V Stores (Badger).

* **VCS:** Git.

* **QA:** linting, unit testing, CI (Drone, Travis, GitLab CI, Bitbucket
  Pipelines, GolangCI, GitHub Actions), CD.

* **Systems administration:** Linux (Debian, Alpine), Shell Scripting,
  Containers (Docker), Containers orchestration (Docker Swarm, Kubernetes).

* **Cloud:** GitHub Pages, Netlify, ZEIT Now, Heroku, Google Cloud Platform.

* **Frameworks and libs:** Bleve, Hugo.

Take a look at my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dbXk7CYAAG_MefJ4i5bddwkH6z9esE-y-NjpB1_PGdQ/edit?usp=sharing) ([PDF](/en/cv.pdf)).
