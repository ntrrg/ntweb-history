**ntWeb** is a small site with great intentions. It provides a portfolio, a
blogging platform, Go packages vanity URLs and a JSON API.

Probably anyone could think of this as a really simple project and its author
is a bad frontend developer, and actually, it is true in some way because it is
not my profile, but its simplicity is intentional (and it is written with
modern web technologies).

[Hugo]: https://gohugo.io
[Go]: https://golang.org
[Mage]: https://magefile.org

The website is created by [Hugo][] and some parts of the content are generated
by [Go][] and [Mage][] (specifically the projects and the Go packages vanity
URLs).

For been printed in the web browser, the home page downloads ~30 KB (~12 KB
without favicons), this page downloads ~265 KB (including its images). It is
functional without JavaScript and can be visualized on TUI web browsers.

Its content may be fetched as JSON, so creating new complex frontends is
trivial without the need for content duplication. Since it is a static API, it
has good performance because of the lack of computing complexity (just reading
a file), it is more resistant to cyber-attacks because there is no database
server and it can be hosted in any service supporting static files.

# API

Almost any HTML page has a JSON output format, it could be fetched by appending
`index.json` to its URL, so the JSON URL of this page should be
`https://nt.web.ve/en/projects/ntweb/index.json`.

Every page has the following properties:

`url` (string):
: Resource URL.

`kind` (string):
: Resource type. It may be one of `home`, `section`, `taxonomyTerm`, `taxonomy`
or `page`.

`type` (string):
: Content type. It may be one of `blog`, `gallery`, `projects`, `tag` or
`page`.

`lang` (string):
: Resource language.

`title` (string):
: Resource title.

`image` (string):
: Resource image URL.

`params` (string):
: Resource frontmatter parameters. This may be different from page types.

`content` (base64 encoded string):
: Resource rendered Markdown content. Notice that this contains a UTF-8 string
and JavaScript strings are UTF-16.

`data` (object):
: Resource specific data. For the main page, this contains all the sections,
taxonomies and top-level pages; for collections this contains its elements and
pagination information; and for single elements this is an empty object.

`altLang` (array of objects):
: Resource translations. Every object has the `lang` and `url` properties.

`altMediaType` (array of objects):
: Resource alternative formats. Every object has the `mediaType` and `url`
properties.
